Project Description
A browser-based app that listens for any sound in a classroom — from talking to sneezing — and responds with an extremely loud, extremely annoying, high-pitched noise.
If the room is silent, it does nothing… until someone inevitably coughs and chaos resumes.

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
Teachers complain about noisy students. Students complain about noisy teachers.
We decided to ignore both and instead create a device that screams at everyone equally.
Who asked for this? No one. Who’s suffering? Everyone.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We trained no AI, ran no complex algorithms, and definitely solved nothing.
Instead, we built a browser app that:
Listens to everything you say (and don’t say) using your microphone.
Detects when you’re even slightly louder than a whisper.
Punishes you instantly with a high-pitched 1.2 kHz sawtooth scream — because pain is the universal language.
Increases volume proportional to your crime (i.e., your noise level).
Technologies/Components Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Web Audio API

Languages Used
HTML – for structuring the web page.
CSS – for styling the page elements.
JavaScript – for detecting sound through the microphone and triggering the scream sound.


Libraries Used

Web Audio API (built-in in browsers) – for accessing microphone input and detecting volume levels.
Howler.js (optional) – for easier handling and playing of audio in different browsers.



Implementation

First, we ask the browser to spy on the microphone.
We filter the sound to focus on voice frequencies, because that’s where the fun is.
When the sound crosses a certain threshold, our oscillator kicks in with a 1.2 kHz sawtooth scream.
The louder the student, the louder the scream — pure revenge mechanics.
When the class is quiet, we shut up… until someone sneezes.
