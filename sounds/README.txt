ðŸŽµ SOUNDS FOLDER - Add Your Audio Files Here!

This folder should contain your sound files that will be played when sound is detected.

Required files:
- scream.mp3 - High-pitched scream sound
- siren.mp3 - Annoying siren/alarm sound
- fart.mp3 - Silly fart sound (for variety)

You can add more sounds and they will be randomly selected.

Tips for finding sounds:
1. Search for "free sound effects" on websites like:
   - freesound.org
   - zapsplat.com
   - soundbible.com
2. Download short MP3 files (under 5 seconds)
3. Rename them to match the expected filenames
4. Keep file sizes small for faster loading

Alternative: You can modify the soundFiles array in app.js to use different filenames.

Example structure:
sounds/
â”œâ”€â”€ scream.mp3
â”œâ”€â”€ siren.mp3
â”œâ”€â”€ fart.mp3
â””â”€â”€ [your_custom_sound.mp3]
